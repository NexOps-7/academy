if you're not making mistakes, you're not progressing

recovery is about progress not prefection

if sth is worth doing, its worth doing it well

in a sense, i'm glad you're not suffering anymore

less is more

you have common interest, not best friend of the year

work hard

dont let opportunity be a disadvantage

not to change the db distribution of wealth, but grow the overall pie

build the future, win over nature
